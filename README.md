2. Start recording the browser traffic by pressing CTRL + E
3. Once you are recording press CTRL + R to refresh the page, you'll see a single GET request to the page, click that request.
4. Now that the information for that request is opened scroll down to 'Request Headers' and copy your entire cookie's value and paste it into the config where it says 'COOKIE_HERE' and save.
5. Now you an run the script with your targetted combo list and brute force Phantom X accounts.
